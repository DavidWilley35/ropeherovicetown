<p>The controls are easy to learn, but mastering combat and movement <strong>takes practice</strong>, which creates long-term engagement.</p>

<h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>

<p>Let’s break down what you actually do inside the game.</p>

<h3>City Exploration</h3>

<p>The game world is a <strong>large urban environment</strong> filled with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Roads and traffic</li>
<li>Enemy gangs</li>
<li>Secret spots</li>
<li>Mission points</li>
</ul>

<p>You can walk, drive, or swing anywhere.</p>

<p>There is <strong>no strict path</strong>, which makes exploration exciting.</p>

<h3>Combat System</h3>

<p>Combat is fast and arcade-like.</p>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Punch and kick enemies</li>
<li>Use guns or rockets</li>
<li>Destroy vehicles</li>
<li>Escape using rope movement</li>
</ul>

<p>Enemies increase in strength as you progress, so <strong>upgrading gear becomes important</strong>.</p>

<h3>Missions and Progression</h3>

<p>Missions are the <strong>main way to earn money and rewards</strong>.</p>

<p>Typical missions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Defeating criminals</li>
<li>Chasing enemies</li>
<li>Protecting areas</li>
<li>Completing timed challenges</li>
</ul>

<p>Finishing missions unlocks <strong>new weapons, vehicles, and abilities</strong>, making the hero stronger.</p>

<h2>Key Features That Make the Game Stand Out</h2>

<h3>Huge Open Map</h3>
<p>The city feels alive and large enough to explore for hours without boredom.</p>

<h3>Smooth Controls</h3>
<p>Movement, combat, and driving are <strong>simple and responsive</strong>, which is important for mobile gameplay.</p>

<h3>Upgrade System</h3>
<p>You can improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Damage power</li>
<li>Weapon strength</li>
<li>Special abilities</li>
</ul>

<p>This progression makes the hero feel more powerful over time.</p>

<h3>Offline Playability</h3>
<p>One major advantage is that the game can be enjoyed <strong>without constant internet</strong>, making it perfect for travel or limited data users.</p>

<h2>Beginner Tips to Progress Faster</h2>

<p>Starting the game without guidance can feel confusing.  
These tips will save you time.</p>

<h3>1. Focus on Early Missions First</h3>
<p>Avoid random fighting in the beginning.  
Complete <strong>easy missions</strong> to earn quick money and unlock upgrades.</p>

<h3>2. Upgrade Health Before Weapons</h3>
<p>New players often buy weapons first.  
But higher <strong>health and defense</strong> help you survive longer, which is more important early on.</p>

<h3>3. Use Rope Movement to Escape</h3>
<p>If enemies become too strong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swing to rooftops</li>
<li>Create distance</li>
<li>Heal and return</li>
</ul>

<p>Running away smartly is part of winning.</p>

<h3>4. Explore for Hidden Rewards</h3>
<p>Some areas contain:</p>
<ul>

<li>Vehicles</li>
<li>Secret items</li>
</ul>

<p>Exploration can speed up progress without grinding missions.</p>

<h3>5. Save Money for Powerful Gear</h3>
<p>Avoid spending on weak weapons.  
Wait until you can afford <strong>high-damage equipment</strong> that truly helps in tough missions.</p>

<h2>Advanced Strategies for Experienced Players</h2>

<p>Once you understand the basics, these strategies can make gameplay smoother.</p>

<h3>Combine Rope + Combat</h3>
<p>Swing above enemies and attack from height.  
This reduces damage taken and increases control.</p>

<h3>Master Vehicle Use</h3>
<p>Different vehicles help in different missions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast cars for chase missions</li>
<li>Heavy vehicles for destruction tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>Choosing the right vehicle saves time.</p>

<h3>Farm Easy Missions for Cash</h3>
<p>Instead of struggling in hard missions, repeat <strong>quick and easy tasks</strong> to gather money efficiently.</p>

<p>Best upgrade priority:</p>
<ol>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Damage</li>
<li>Special abilities</li>
<li>Extra weapons</li>
</ol>

<p>This order balances survival and power.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes New Players Make</h2>

<p>Avoiding these mistakes can improve your experience immediately.</p>

<h3>Ignoring Missions</h3>
<p>Free roaming is fun, but missions are needed for <strong>real progress</strong>.</p>

<h3>Spending Money Randomly</h3>
<p>Buying every weapon slows down long-term growth.</p>

<h3>Fighting Too Many Enemies at Once</h3>
<p>Smart movement is better than reckless combat.</p>

<h3>Forgetting to Upgrade</h3>
<p>Unupgraded heroes struggle in later stages.</p>
